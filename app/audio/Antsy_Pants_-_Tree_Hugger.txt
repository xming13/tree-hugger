[00:19.52]The flower said, "I wish I was a tree."
[00:21.64]The tree said, "I wish I could be
[00:24.00]A different kind of tree."
[00:26.68]The cat wished that it was a bee,
[00:29.02]The turtle wished that it could fly,
[00:31.49]Really high into the sky,
[00:33.82]Over rooftops and then dive
[00:36.15]Deep into the sea.
[00:37.24]
[00:38.34]And in the sea there is a fish,
[00:40.66]A fish that has a secret wish;
[00:43.08]A wish to be a big cactus,
[00:45.33]With a pink flower on it.
[00:47.76]And in the sea there is a fish,
[00:50.10]A fish that has a secret wish;
[00:52.69]A wish to be a big cactus,
[00:54.68]With a pink flower on it.
[00:56.60]
[00:56.95]And the flower
[00:58.85]Would be its offering
[01:01.51]Of love, to the desert.
[01:06.20]And the desert,
[01:08.81]So dry and lonely,
[01:10.88]That the creatures all
[01:12.57]Appreciate the effort.
[01:16.50]
[01:17.00]Et le jackalope a dit, <br>(And the Jackalope said,)
[01:19.00]"Je voudrais &ecirc;tre un yeti, <br>("I'd like to be a yeti,) 
[01:21.00]Pour voler dans la nuit <br>(To flee in the night)
[01:24.00]Et men aller loin dici." <br>(And go far from here.") 
[01:27.00]Mais le yeti a dit, <br>(But the yeti said,)
[01:29.00]"Je voudrais &ecirc;tre un monstre marin, <br>("I would like to be a sea monster,)
[01:31.00]Pour pouvoir rentrer dans la mer, <br>(So I could go on the sea,) 
[01:33.00]De tous les requins." <br>(With all the sharks.")
[01:33.50]
[01:34.00]And the rattlesnake said,
[01:35.14]"I wish I had hands so
[01:37.82]I could hug you like a man."
[01:39.68]And then the cactus said,
[01:42.23]"Don't you understand?
[01:44.38]My skin is covered with sharp spikes,
[01:46.71]That'll stab you like a thousand knives.
[01:49.20]A hug would be nice,
[01:51.17]But hug my flower with your eyes."
[01:54.24]The flower said, "I wish I was a tree."
[01:55.99]The tree said, "I wish I could be
[01:58.58]A different kind of tree."
[02:01.01]The cat wished that it was a bee,
[02:03.42]The turtle wished that it could fly,
[02:05.89]Really high into the sky,
[02:08.39]Over rooftops and then dive
[02:10.45]Deep into the sea.
[02:12.18]
[02:12.83]And in the sea there is a fish,
[02:15.24]A fish that has a secret wish;
[02:17.69]A wish to be a big cactus,
[02:19.88]With a pink flower on it.
[02:22.43]And in the sea there is a fish,
[02:24.82]A fish that has a secret wish;
[02:27.16]A wish to be a big cactus,
[02:29.63]With a pink flower on it.
[02:30.98]
[02:31.62]And the flower
[02:33.86]Would be its offering
[02:36.01]Of love, to the desert.
[02:40.88]And the desert,
[02:43.17]So dry and lonely,
[02:45.74]That the creatures all, 
[02:47.43]Appreciate the effort.
